# bootstrap_vs_jackknife

A repository to compare the bootstrap and jackknife methods of sampling

## Description

The goal of this project is simply to explore the difference between the bootrsamping and jackknife methods of creating cofindence intervals.  Each method has it's pro and cons and I am curious how these methods will work on different datasets.  I have not picked my datasets yet.
